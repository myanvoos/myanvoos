Currently, I'm a third-year undergrad mathematics and computer science student at the University of Auckland. I am a TA for CS130 (data structures & algorithms) and various introductory maths courses. I was also an AI/ML summer research scholar in the School of Computer Science.

I'm interested in AI reasoning, memory, and architectures as implemented in the [Titans paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00663). I'm also broadly interested in Lenia -- so-called "mathematical lifeforms", computational neuroscience, and general software development.
