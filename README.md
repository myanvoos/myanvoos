### MATHS 250 - Algebra and Calculus 2 ###
   - [x] Linear algebra and calculus with semi-rigorous proofs. I got permission from the Department of Mathematics to skip over its First Year prerequisites and take it in my first semester of university.

### MATHS 254 - Fundamental Concepts of Mathematics ### 
  - [x] Gentle introduction to assorted topics in pure mathematics. Not as proof-heavy as I'd expected. Same as MATHS 250, I got faculty permission to take this in my first semester of university.

### COMPSCI 130 - Introduction to Software Fundamentals ###
  - [x] Programming in Python. Involves some data structures and their implementations.

### MATHS 162 - Computational Mathematics ###
  - [x] Introduction to MATLAB.

<summary><h3>2023 S2</h3></summary><p>
  
### MATHS 332 - Real Analysis ###
  - [x] Standard real analysis course that follows right up from MATHS 250 and MATHS 254. But also, wow.
        
### MATHS 340 - Real and Complex Calculus ###
  - [x] This course introduces complex calculus/analysis, but in more applied way. Also introduces volume and area integrals, curl, divergence, etc.

### MATHS 260 - Differential Equations ###
  - [x] Ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Really chill and interesting course.

### PHYSICS 121 - Advancing Physics 2 ###
  - [x] Relativity and quantum mechanics were the best parts of this course.

<summary><h3>2024 S1</h3></summary><p>
  
### COMPSCI 220 - Algorithms and Data Structures ###
  - [x] I took this course without COMPSCI 120 (wasn't allowed to because I took Third Year maths). Not as 'theoretical' as I'd expected.

### COMPSCI 230 - Object Oriented Software Development ###
  - [x] Introduction to Java programming. 

### STATS 101 - Introduction to Statistics ###
  - [x] Standard statistics course.

### STATS 220 - Data Technologies ###
  - [x] Introduction to R and RMarkdown (this is the main inspiration behind Cortex!)

<summary><h3>2024 S2</h3></summary><p>
  
### COMPSCI 335 - Web Programming and Distributed Services ###
  - [x] Very straightforward if you already knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript beforehand.

### COMPSCI 367 - Artificial Intelligence ###
  - [x] Classical AI. Extremely interesting personally, especially the first-order logic and planning section.

### MATHS 270 - Numerical Analysis ###
  - [x] MATLAB course, but I rewrote all the algorithms in Rust.

### COMPSCI 110 - Introduction to Computer Systems ###
  - [x] Very helpful for planning out the grammar and parser for Cortex.
